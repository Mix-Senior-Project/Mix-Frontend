# Mix
Mix is a social media platform that drives to innovate the way users think of and interact with networking platforms. As our name suggests, we want users to mix and mingle with others on our platform! Whether you share an interest with a group or want to get involved in a new community, Mix provides group or ‘interest-specific’ features for content creation and sharing. Our platform provides a toolbox for communities to promote engagement and interconnectedness. Consider us as a Home Depot with many tools, but not as construction workers! That’s where the Mix community comes in.   

On the Mix platform, user content is meant to be approached as ‘blogs’ where users are both sharing content and engaging with various communities, all while maintaining their personal timeline in an easily accessible format. Mix provides multi-media posting, which includes images, text, videos, streams, audio recordings, and others.
